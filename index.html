<b>This is my (Nicolas DiFurio) website, maybe it will become something of value</b>

<br>
I'm creating a website for my step-mothers interior design work. The user base will be future and current employers. My goals are to actively pertray her work, in a user friendly website. The first page will contain a glance at recent work, a horizontal navigation panel, maybe a few words of discription on the page, for titles or listing credit for photos, nothing major like a block of text to read. Will also include company/brand logo.
